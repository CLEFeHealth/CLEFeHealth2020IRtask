# CLEFeHealth2020IRtask
Official repository for the CLEF 2020 eHealth Lab, IR Task. 

This task is a continuation of the previous CLEF eHealth information retrieval (IR) tasks that ran in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and embraces the TREC-style evaluation process, with a shared collection of documents and queries, the contribution of runs from participants and the subsequent formation of relevance assessments and evaluation of the participants submissions.

This year's IR task will continue the growth path identified previously in CLEF eHealth information retrieval challenges. 

The 2020 task uses the same document collection and queries as in 2018, and aims at increasing the size of the pooled documents for evaluation.
